<p>You’ve made it to the end of all the chapters – I hope you’re proud of all the work you’ve put in! Don’t worry if you found some things hard: topics such as closures and optionals <em>are</em> hard, so if they took some time to learn that’s just a sign your brain is working properly.</p>
<p>Now, the question is: where can you go next? Well, you have two options. The first is to continue with all the practice activities you've unlocked and take your daily challenges – this will help you solidify all the things you've learned so far.</p>
<p>The second is to check out the range of books I've written that I hope will help you answer that question:</p>
