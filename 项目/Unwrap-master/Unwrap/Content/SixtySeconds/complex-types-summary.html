<p>You’ve made it to the end of the second part of this series, so let’s summarize:</p>
<ol>
<li>Arrays, sets, tuples, and dictionaries let you store a group of items under a single value. They each do this in different ways, so which you use depends on the behavior you want.</li>
<li>Arrays store items in the order you add them, and you access them using numerical positions.</li>
<li>Sets store items without any order, so you can’t access them using numerical positions.</li>
<li>Tuples are fixed in size, and you can attach names to each of their items. You can read items using numerical positions or using your names.</li>
<li>Dictionaries store items according to a key, and you can read items using those keys.</li>
<li>Enums are a way of grouping related values so you can use them without spelling mistakes.</li>
<li>You can attach raw values to enums so they can be created from integers or strings, or you can add associated values to store additional information about each case.</li>
