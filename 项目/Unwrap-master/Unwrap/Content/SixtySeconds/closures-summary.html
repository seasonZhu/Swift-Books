<p>You’ve made it to the end of the sixth part of this series, so let’s summarize:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can assign closures to variables, then call them later on.</li>
<li>Closures can accept parameters and return values, like regular functions.</li>
<li>You can pass closures into functions as parameters, and those closures can have parameters of their own and a return value.</li>
<li>If the last parameter to your function is a closure, you can use trailing closure syntax.</li>
<li>Swift automatically provides shorthand parameter names like <code>$0</code> and <code>$1</code>, but not everyone uses them.</li>
<li>If you use external values inside your closures, they will be captured so the closure can refer to them later.</li>
