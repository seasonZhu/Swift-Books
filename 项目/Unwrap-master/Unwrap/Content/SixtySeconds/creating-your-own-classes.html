<p>Classes are similar to structs in that they allow you to create new types with properties and methods, but they have five important differences and Iâ€™m going to walk you through each of those differences one at a time.</p>
<p>The first difference between classes and structs is that classes never come with a memberwise initializer. This means if you have properties in your class, you must always create your own initializer.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="code">
<p></p>
<p><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="class-name">Dog</span> <span class="punctuation">{</span></p>
<p>  <span class="keyword">var</span> name<span class="punctuation">:</span> <span class="builtin">String</span></p>
<p>  <span class="keyword">var</span> breed<span class="punctuation">:</span> <span class="builtin">String</span></p>
<p>  <span class="keyword">init</span><span class="punctuation">(</span>name<span class="punctuation">:</span> <span class="builtin">String</span><span class="punctuation">,</span> breed<span class="punctuation">:</span> <span class="builtin">String</span><span class="punctuation">)</span> <span class="punctuation">{</span></p>
<p>    <span class="keyword">self</span><span class="punctuation">.</span>name <span class="operator">=</span> name</p>
<p>    <span class="keyword">self</span><span class="punctuation">.</span>breed <span class="operator">=</span> breed</p>
<p>  <span class="punctuation">}</span></p>
<p><span class="punctuation">}</span></p>
<p></p>
</pre>

<p style="height: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"></p>
<p>Creating instances of that class looks just the same as if it were a struct:</p>
<pre class="code">
<p></p>
<p><span class="keyword">let</span> poppy <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="function">Dog</span><span class="punctuation">(</span>name<span class="punctuation">:</span> <span class="string">"Poppy"</span><span class="punctuation">,</span> breed<span class="punctuation">:</span> <span class="string">"Poodle"</span><span class="punctuation">)</span></p>
<p></p>
</pre>
