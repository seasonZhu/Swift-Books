# Unwrap
**Copyright (c) 2019 Paul Hudson**

Unwrap is a complex project made up of various parts. I want you to be able to re-use as much of the code as possible, so please make sure you read and understand all the below before continuing.


## Source code: go for it!

All the source code that goes into Unwrap is licensed under the MIT license. To be clear, this is any file that has the “.swift” file extension. Here is the MIT license:

## Content: for reference only

All the *assets* for Unwrap – any JSON, PDFs, PNGs, HTML, movies, and so on, are *not* licensed under the MIT license, which means you aren’t able to redistribute them.

It is *really* important that you understand the distinction here, because I don’t want you to get in trouble. For example, I have specifically been granted permission by a variety of members of the Swift community to ship their logos as part of the Unwrap project, and that same permission does not automatically stretch to you.


## Why the distinction?

I want anyone who is interested to be able to read the code for Unwrap, learn from it, contribute back if they want to, and use it in their own projects. If you know much about open-source licenses, you’ll know that the MIT license is one of the least-restrictive out there.

However, I do *not* want an army of clones, all copying my tutorials without actually contributing anything fresh. Even before I released Unwrap under an open license, someone took all the code, content, movies, and more, and released it on the App Store without any attribution, and that sucks. They were on the receiving end of an App Store takedown notice from Apple.

So, to keep things as simple as possible:

- If a file has the extension “.swift” – i.e., if it gets compiled and run as part of the executable program – then it’s under the MIT license. You can take it, modify it, re-use it, distribute it, sell it, etc.
- All other files are there for your reference so you can see how the app works, but please do not redistribute them in any form.
