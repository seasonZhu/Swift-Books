<p>You’ve made it to the end of the third part of this series, so let’s summarize:</p>
<ol>
<li>Swift has operators for doing arithmetic and for comparison; they mostly work like you already know.</li>
<li>There are compound variants of arithmetic operators that modify their variables in place: <code>+=</code>, <code>-=</code>, and so on.</li>
<li>You can use <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, and <code>else if</code> to run code based on the result of a condition.</li>
<li>Swift has a ternary operator that combines a check with true and false code blocks. Although you might see it in other code, I wouldn’t recommend using it yourself.</li>
<li>If you have multiple conditions using the same value, it’s often clearer to use <code>switch</code> instead.</li>
<li>You can make ranges using <code>..&lt;</code> and <code>...</code> depending on whether the last number should be excluded or included.</li>
