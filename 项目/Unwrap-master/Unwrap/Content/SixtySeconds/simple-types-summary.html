<p>You’ve made it to the end of the first part of this series, so let’s summarize.</p>
<ol>
<li>You make variables using <code>var</code> and constants using <code>let</code>. It’s preferable to use constants as often as possible.</li>
<li>Strings start and end with double quotes, but if you want them to run across multiple lines you should use three sets of double quotes.</li>
<li>Integers hold whole numbers, doubles hold fractional numbers, and booleans hold true or false.</li>
<li>String interpolation allows you to create strings from other variables and constants, placing their values inside your string.</li>
<li>Swift uses type inference to assign each variable or constant a type, but you can provide explicit types if you want.</li>
