<p>You’ve made it to the end of the seventh part of this series, so let’s summarize:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can create your own types using structures, which can have their own properties and methods.</li>
<li>You can use stored properties or use computed properties to calculate values on the fly.</li>
<li>If you want to change a property inside a method, you must mark it as <code>mutating</code>.</li>
<li>Initializers are special methods that create structs. You get a memberwise initializer by default, but if you create your own you must give all properties a value.</li>
<li>Use the <code>self</code> constant to refer to the current instance of a struct inside a method.</li>
<li>The <code>lazy</code> keyword tells Swift to create properties only when they are first used.</li>
<li>You can share properties and methods across all instances of a struct using the <code>static</code> keyword.</li>
<li>Access control lets you restrict what code can use properties and methods.</li>
</ol>
