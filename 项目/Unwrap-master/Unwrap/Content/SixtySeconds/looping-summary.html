<p>You’ve made it to the end of the fourth part of this series, so let’s summarize:</p>
<ol>
<li>Loops let us repeat code until a condition is false.</li>
<li>The most common loop is <code>for</code>, which assigns each item inside the loop to a temporary constant.</li>
<li>If you don’t need the temporary constant that <code>for</code> loops give you, use an underscore instead so Swift can skip that work.</li>
<li>There are <code>while</code> loops, which you provide with an explicit condition to check.</li>
<li>Although they are similar to <code>while</code> loops, <code>repeat</code> loops always run the body of their loop at least once.</li>
<li>You can exit a single loop using <code>break</code>, but if you have nested loops you need to use <code>break</code> followed by whatever label you placed before your outer loop.</li>
<li>You can skip items in a loop using <code>continue</code>.</li>
<li>Infinite loops don’t end until you ask them to, and are made using <code>while true</code>. Make sure you have a condition somewhere to end your infinite loops!</li>
